AutoScout24 Scala Test Task
================================================
A simple REST API for the `adverts` resource backed by a Scala CRUD application made with:
 - [Play 2.4](https://www.playframework.com/) 
 - [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.1.1/) 
 - [Play-Slick](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/PlaySlick) 
 - [H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) in-memory/file database (for test purposes, easily swappable to other relational DB engines (i.e MySQL, Postgres) thanks to Slick).



More Information
================

- Swagger UI is available at <http://localhost:9000/docs/> after the application starts to evaluate and test all `advert` API endpoints
- A [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection useful to browse/test the API is also available in the root folder [here](Car Adverts API.postman_collection.json) 
- Project uses [Evolutions](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Evolutions) to perform database schema migrations. The initial migration to setup the base schema will run at application startup, no configuration work is needed.
- CORS is fully enabled on all endpoints.
  
Usage
================
### Running

You need to download and install sbt for this application to run.

Once you have sbt installed, the following at the command prompt will start up the application:

```bash
sbt run
```

Application will start up on the HTTP port at <http://localhost:9000/>.   

### Sample Usage

If you call the same URL from the command line, youâ€™ll see JSON. Using httpie, we can execute the command:

```bash
http --verbose http://localhost:9000/adverts
```

and get back:

```routes
GET /adverts HTTP/1.1
```

Likewise, you can also send a POST directly as JSON:

```bash
http --verbose POST http://localhost:9000/adverts title="BMW M4" fuel="Gasoline" price:=60000000 isNew:=true
```

and get:

```routes
POST /v1/posts HTTP/1.1
```
